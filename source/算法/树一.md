# trees树(一)

注：先学习图，再学习本章节。

A **tree** is a connected, acyclic graph that consists of *n* nodes and *n* − 1 edges. Removing any edge from a tree divides it into two components, and adding any edge to a tree creates a cycle. Moreover, there is always a unique path between any two nodes of a tree.（树是图的一部分，连通的，无环，有n个顶点，n-1条边）

The **leaves** of a tree are the nodes with degree 1, i.e., with only one neighbor.

In a **rooted** tree, one of the nodes is appointed the **root** of the tree, and all other nodes are placed underneath the root. For example, in the following tree, node 1 is the root node.

</center>

In a rooted tree, the **children** of a node are its lower neighbors, and the **parent** of a node is its upper neighbor. Each node has exactly one parent, except for the root that does not have a parent. For example, in the above tree, the children of node 2 are nodes 5 and 6, and its parent is node 1.

The structure of a rooted tree is *recursive*: each node of the tree acts as the root of a **subtree** that contains the node itself and all nodes that are in the subtrees of its children. For example, in the above tree, the subtree of node 2 consists of nodes 2, 5, 6 and 8:

### Tree traversal树的遍历

General graph traversal algorithms can be used to traverse the nodes of a tree. However, the traversal of a tree is easier to implement than that of a general graph, because there are no cycles in the tree and it is not possible to reach a node from multiple directions.

The typical way to traverse a tree is to start a depth-first search at an arbitrary node. The following recursive function can be used:

```cpp
void dfs(int s, int e) { //e代表父亲节点
    // process node s
    for (auto u : adj[s]) {
       if (u != e) dfs(u, s);
    }
}
```

The function is given two parameters: the current node *s* and the previous node *e*. The purpose of the parameter *e* is to make sure that the search only moves to nodes that have not been visited yet.

```cpp
//In the first call e = 0, because there is no previous node, 
//and it is allowed to proceed to any direction in the tree.
	dfs(x, 0);
```



**Dynamic programming使用dp求子树大小(应用)**

Dynamic programming can be used to calculate some information during a tree traversal. Using dynamic programming, we can, for example, calculate in *O*(*n*) time for each node of a rooted tree the number of nodes in its subtree or the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf.

As an example, let us calculate for each node *s* a value count[*s*]: the number of nodes in its subtree. The subtree contains the node itself and all nodes in the subtrees of its children, so we can calculate the number of nodes recursively using the following code:

```cpp
void dfs(int s, int e) {
    count[s] = 1;
    for (auto u : adj[s]) {
       if (u == e) continue;
       dfs(u, s);
       count[s] += count[u];
	} 
}
```



### Diameter树的直径

The **diameter** of a tree is the maximum length of a path between two nodes. Forexample, consider the following tree:

<center>

![](../media/image-20210204153506250.png)

</center>

Note that there may be several maximum-length paths. In the above path, we could replace node 6 with node 5 to obtain another path with length 4.

Next we will discuss two ***O*(*n*)** time algorithms for calculating the diameter of a tree. The first algorithm is based on dynamic programming, and the second algorithm uses two depth-first searches.

##### **Algorithm 1**

**A general way to approach many tree problems is to first root the tree arbitrarily. After this, we can try to solve the problem separately for each subtree.**  Our first algorithm for calculating the diameter is based on this idea.

An important observation is that every path in a rooted tree has a *highest point*: the highest node that belongs to the path. Thus, we can calculate for each node the length of the longest path whose highest point is the node. One of those paths corresponds to the diameter of the tree.

For example, in the following tree, node 1 is the highest point on the path that corresponds to the diameter:

<center>

![](../media/image-20210204154113525.png)

</center>

We calculate for each node *x* two values:

* **toLeaf(*x*): **the maximum length of a path from *x* to any leaf
* **maxLength(*x*):** the maximum length of a path whose highest point is *x*

For example, in the above tree, toLeaf(1) = 2, because there is a path 1 → 2 → 6, and maxLength(1)=4, because there is a path 6→2→1→4→7. In this case, maxLength(1) equals the diameter.

Dynamic programming can be used to calculate the above values for all nodes in ***O*(*n*)** time. First, to calculate toLeaf(*x*), we go through the children of *x*, choose a child *c* with maximum toLeaf(*c*) and add one to this value. Then, to calculate maxLength(*x*), we choose two distinct children *a* and *b* such that the sum toLeaf(*a*) + toLeaf(*b*) is maximum and add two to this sum.

```cpp
//类似floyd呢
//还没实现过这种写法,要写一下
```



##### **Algorithm 2 两次dfs**

Another efficient way to calculate the diameter of a tree is based on two depth- first searches. First, we choose an arbitrary node *a* in the tree and find the farthest node *b* from *a*. Then, we find the farthest node *c* from *b*. The diameter of the tree is the distance between *b* and *c*.

In the following graph, *a*, *b* and *c* could be:

<center>

![](../media/image-20210204154340195.png)

</center>

This is an elegant method, but why does it work?

It helps to draw the tree differently so that the path that corresponds to the diameter is horizontal, and all other nodes hang from it:

<center>

![](../media/image-20210204154411090.png)

</center>

Node *x* indicates the place where the path from node *a* joins the path that corresponds to the diameter. The farthest node from *a* is node *b*, node *c* or some other node that is at least as far from node *x*. Thus, this node is always a valid choice for an endpoint of a path that corresponds to the diameter.

```cpp
//这个更好实现，就是跑两遍dfs
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

const int N = 100010;

int h[N], e[N * 2], ne[N * 2], w[N * 2], idx;
int dep[N];
int T, n;
int num, maxn;

void add(int a, int b, int c)
{
	e[idx] = b, ne[idx] = h[a], w[idx] = c, h[a] = idx++;
}

void dfs(int u, int fa)
{
	if (dep[u] > maxn) maxn = dep[u], num = u;

	for (int i = h[u]; i != -1; i = ne[i])
	{
		int j = e[i];
		if (j == fa) continue;

		dep[j] = dep[u] + w[i];
		dfs(j, u);
	}
}

int main()
{
	scanf("%d", &T);

	for (int id = 1; id <= T; id++)
	{
		memset(h, -1, sizeof h);
		idx = 0;

		scanf("%d", &n);

		for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
		{
			int a, b, w;
			scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &w);

			a++, b++;
			add(a, b, w);
			add(b, a, w);
		}
		
		maxn = 0;
		memset(dep, 0, sizeof dep);
		dfs(1, 0);
		
		maxn = 0;
		memset(dep, 0, sizeof dep);
		dfs(num, 0);
		
		printf("Case %d: %d\n", id, maxn);
	}
	
	return 0;
}
```



### Binary trees二叉树

A **binary tree** is a rooted tree where each node has a left and right subtree. It is possible that a subtree of a node is empty. Thus, every node in a binary tree has zero, one or two children.

For example, the following tree is a binary tree:

<center>

![](../media/image-20210204161911728.png)

</center>

The nodes of a binary tree have three natural orderings that correspond to different ways to recursively traverse the tree:

* **pre-order**: first process the root, then traverse the left subtree, then traverse the right subtree
* **in-order**: first traverse the left subtree, then process the root, then traverse the right subtree
* **post-order**: first traverse the left subtree, then traverse the right subtree, then process the root

For the above tree, the nodes in pre-order are [1,2,4,5,6,3,7], in in-order [4,2,6,5,1,3,7] and in post-order [4,6,5,2,7,3,1].

If we know **the pre-order and in-order** of a tree, we can reconstruct the exact structure of the tree. For example, the above tree is the only possible tree with pre-order [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7] and in-order [4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 3, 7]. In a similar way, **the post-order and in-order** also determine the structure of a tree.

However, the situation is different if we only know the pre-order and post- order of a tree. In this case, there may be more than one tree that match the orderings. For example, in both of the trees the pre-order is [1,2] and the post-order is [2,1], but the structures of the trees are different.
